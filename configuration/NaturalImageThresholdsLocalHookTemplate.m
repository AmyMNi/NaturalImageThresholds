% For use with the ToolboxToolbox.  If you copy this into your
% ToolboxToolbox localToolboxHooks directory (by default,
% ~/localHookFolder) and delete "Template" from the filename,
% this will get run when you execute tbUseProject('NaturalImageThresholds') to set up for
% this project.  You then edit your local copy to match your configuration.
%
% You will need to edit the project location and i/o directory locations
% to match what is true on your computer.
